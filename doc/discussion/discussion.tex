This chapter rounds off the description of the project.
\Cref{sec:limitations} places the delivered work in the established context.
A critical appraisal of some of the limitations, as well as the strengths, are described therein.
The delivered work doesn't have to be the final, definitive solution.
Given the limitations described, and building on the strengths, there remains plenty of space to extend the \lsr{} framework, and take it far further.
With some optimism, the future work is described in \cref{sec:future-work}.
