This chapter rounds off the description of the project.
\Cref{sec:placing} places the delivered work in the established context.
A critical appraisal of some of the limitations, as well as the strengths, are described in sec:lim-future.
The delivered work doesn't have to be the final, definitive solution.
Given the limitations described, and building on the strengths, there remains plenty of space to extend the \lsr{} framework, and take it far further.
With some optimism, the future work is described therein.
