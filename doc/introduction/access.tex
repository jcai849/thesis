Access to a working implementation as a result of this project can be gained via the \href{https://rforge.com/largescaler}{Rforge largescaler page}\footnote{\url{https://rforge.com/largescaler}}.
This gives the whole version controlled source code of the system, as well as some demo programs that can be run locally on a computer with a large amount of memory.
The \textsc{README} in the \lsr{} Rforge file explains the minimal steps required to run both an example model where all communication is visible, as well as a basic setup with a distributed dataset ready for any further testing on the part of the user.
