The \lsr{} system has been proven over a number of application areas.
Data manipulation is a basic necessity, as it is required for modelling, and is provided well by other systems.
\lsr{} is capable of a full set of data manipulations, including all that are provided by the \pkg{dplyr} package.
Model fitting is demonstrated in the proof-of-concept \pkg{largescalemodels} package, which includes a variety of models, including linear models and generalised linear models.
Work is currently underway to develop examples of boosted models, as well as convex optimisation methods such as the alternating direction method of multipliers.

The scope for future work remains significant, enabled by the high level of extensibility provided by the system.
External systems which serve to monitor performance or take up the role of garbage collection would grant the possibility of greater reliability.
Robustness could be gained through self-healing datasets, a potential that has a precedent in a current prototype, which allows for resilience to node failure in a more efficient manner than that of the current Resilient Distributed Datasets~\cite{zaharia2012resilient}.
Further resilience can be gained within the system through operating the location service as a distributed hash table, leaving no central point of failure in a fully peer-to-peer system.
