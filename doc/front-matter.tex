    With the growing scale of big datasets, fitting novel statistical models on larger-than-memory datasets becomes correspondingly challenging.
    A variety of techniques exist in an attempt to solve this problem in a general case, with generally subpar results in practice among statisticians.
    In the absence of a sound interface and conceptual structure for designing statistical algorithms for large scale data, the large-scale statistical modelling field has lacked the accessibility and results that it otherwise may have possessed.
    This thesis outlines the development and use of a platform created specifically for the development of statistical models for big datasets.
    Requirements for such a platform are constructed and justified, including a formally specified interface.
    The delivered platform satisfies satisfies such requirements, and serves as a functioning example of what form a large scale statistical modelling platform backed by sound conceptual requirements may take.
