This chapter provides implementation details supporting the system delivered and described by the API as given in Chapter \ref{sec:ui}.
Different implementation decisions could have been alternatively formed, to support the same API; as such, this is an as-built record of the decisions that were made in implementation, and are secondary to the principle offering of this project, which is the API.
The structure given is to work from the top-down, with demonstrations of each layer being composed by its undergirding layer.
This involves a case-study form of walkthrough of another construction of a distributed statistical model here a \code{Reduce()}-based Linear Model, followed by a descent along each system layer, rounding off with a description of the \proglang{C}-level networking architecture underpinning the entire system.
