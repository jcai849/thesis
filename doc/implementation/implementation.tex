This chapter provides implementation details supporting the system delivered and described by the API as given in Chapter \cref{sec:ui}.
Different implementation decisions could have been alternatively formed, to support the same API; as such, this is an as-built record of the decisions that were made in implementation, and are secondary to the principle offering of this project, which is the API.
The structure given is to work from the bottom-up, with demonstrations of each layer being composed by its undergirding layer.
