This chapter provides implementation details supporting the system delivered and described by the API as given in Chapter \ref{sec:ui}.
The structure given is to work from the top-down, with demonstrations of each layer being composed by its undergirding layer.
This involves a case-study form of walkthrough of the construction of a distributed statistical model, followed by a descent along each system layer, rounding off with a description of the \proglang{C}-level networking architecture underpinning the entire system.
