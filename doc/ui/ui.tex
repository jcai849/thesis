Given the growing complexity of the final prototype discussed, it was deemed appropriate to attempt to consolidate the components which had proven to be essential in the system, and factor them into a cohesive system for final delivery.
This chapter presents the User Interface for the consolidated system, in four measures; first, a description of the modules composing the API, given by Section \ref{sec:sysmod}.
This is followed by an example-led tour of the core functions offered by the main system module in Section \ref{sec:api-example}.
Sections \ref{sec:api-high} and \ref{sec:api-low}  round out the remainder of the high-level modules and low-level modules respectively.
