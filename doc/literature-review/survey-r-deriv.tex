\subsection{ML Services on HDInight}\label{subsec:r-server-hdinsight}

\pkg{ML Services on HDInsight}, also referred to as \pkg{\R Server}, is a
distribution of \R with particular emphasis on parallel and
capabilities\cite{azure16:_r_server_hdins_r_analy}. Specific
parallel capabilities advertised include multi-threaded mathematics
libraries. \pkg{\R Server} for HDInsight was previously named \pkg{Revolution R}, and
developed by Revolution Analytics, before being bought out by Microsoft,
renamed \pkg{Microsoft R}, before acquiring the name \pkg{\R server for HDInsight},
before changing to \pkg{ML Services}.
The art of bold package naming requires one to be equally bold in renaming.

\subsection{IBM Big R}\label{subsec:ibm-big-r}

\pkg{IBM Big \R} is a library of functions integrating \R with the \pkg{IBM
InfoSphere BigInsights platform}\cite{inc.14:_infos_bigin_big_r}.
This is implemented through the introduction of various \pkg{bigr} classes
replicating base \R types. These are then run in the background on the
BigInsights platform, which is in turn powered by Apache \pkg{Hadoop}. The
user is therefore able to run MapReduce jobs without having to
explicitly write MapReduce-specific code.

\subsection{MapR}\label{sec:mapr}

\pkg{MapR} initially provided \R access to \pkg{Hadoop}, being mainly HDFS
access\cite{mapr19:_indus_next_gener_data_platf_ai_analy}. It was
then bought out by HP in May 2019, pivoting to selling an enterprise
database platform and analytics services, running on \pkg{Hadoop} among other
backends. Development has ceased on \R access.
