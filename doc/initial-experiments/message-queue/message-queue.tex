\subsection{Overview}\label{mqintro}

Due to the limitations in the previous experiment, as described in \cref{sec:eval}, a new system is introduced in this section.
The defining feature of this system is the usage of a central message queue.
The introduction of this structure ameliorates many of the listed problems, such as the inefficiencies of synchrony, though the new freedom gained for asynchrony renders new issues.
Here it is considered how these new issues are accounted for, and the extent to which it is possible.
The general architecture and interactions with pre-existing data structures, such as chunks, are further described herein.
