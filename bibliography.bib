  abstract  = {The mismatch between the operational semantics of the lambda calculus and the actual
               behavior of implementations is a major obstacle for compiler writers. They cannot
               explain the behavior of their evaluator in terms of source level syntax, and they
               cannot easily compare distinct implementations of different lazy strategies. In this
               paper we derive an equational characterization of call-by-need and prove it correct
               with respect to the original lambda calculus. The theory is a strictly smaller theory
               than the lambda calculus. Immediate applications of the theory concern the correctness
               proofs of a number of implementation strategies, e.g., the call-by-need continuation
               passing transformation and the realization of sharing via assignments.},

  abstract  = {Lazy programs are beautiful, but slow. A great deal of work has been done on static analyses (such as strictness analysis, or cheapness analysis) that conservatively estimate where call-by-need can be changed to call-by-value without changing the meaning of the program.
               
               Our measurements show that many of the thunks that remain after such analyses are in fact always evaluated, or are always cheap. In this paper we describe a new evaluation strategy, optimistic evaluation, that explores the space between call-by-need and call-by-value. Optimistic evaluation complements compile-time analyses with run-time experiments: it evaluates a thunk speculatively, but has an abortion mechanism to back out if it makes a bad choice. We add a run-time adaption mechanism so that the system can avoid making the same bad choice again.
               
               We have implemented optimistic evaluation in the Glasgow Haskell Compiler. The results are encouraging: many programs speed up significantly (5-25

  abstract   = {The foundations of functional programming languages are examined from both historical
                and technical perspectives. Their evolution is traced through several critical periods:
                early work on lambda calculus and combinatory calculus, Lisp, Iswim, FP, ML, and modern
                functional languages such as Miranda1 and Haskell. The fundamental premises on which
                the functional programming methodology stands are critically analyzed with respect
                to philosophical, theoretical, and pragmatic concerns. Particular attention is paid
                to the main features that characterize modern functional languages: higher-order functions,
                lazy evaluation, equations and pattern matching, strong static typing and type inference,
                and data abstraction. In addition, current research areas—such as parallelism, nondeterminism,
                input/output, and state-oriented computations—are examined with the goal of predicting
                the future development and application of functional languages.},

  abstract  = {The advantage of lazy functional languages is that programs may be written declaratively
               without specifying the exact evaluation order. The ensuing order of evaluation can
               however be quite involved which makes it difficult to debug such programs using traditional,
               operational techniques. A solution is to trace the computation in a way which focuses
               on the declarative aspects and hides irrelevant operational details. The main problem
               with this approach is the immense cost in time and space of tracing large computations.
               Dealing with these performance issues is thus the key to practical, general purpose
               debuggers for lazy functional languages. In this paper we show that computing partial
               traces on demand by re-executing the traced program is a viable way to overcome these
               difficulties. This allows any program to be traced using only a fixed amount of extra
               storage. Since it takes a lot of time to build a complete trace, most of which is
               wasted since only a fraction of a typical trace is investigated during debugging,
               partial tracing and repeated re-execution is also attractive from a time perspective.
               Performance figures are presented to substantiate our claims.},

Whether you write Web servers, client/server applications, or any other network software, you need to understand networking APIS--especially sockets in greater detail than ever before. You need UNIX Network Programming, Volume 1, Second Edition. In this book, leading UNIX networking expert W. Richard Stevens offers unprecedented, start-to-finish guidance on making the most of sockets, the de facto standard for UNIX network programming--as well as extensive coverage of the X/Open Transport Interface (XTI). Stevens begins by introducing virtually every basic capability of TCP and UDP sockets, including socket functions and options, I/O multiplexing, and name and address conversions. He presents detailed coverage of the Posix.1g standard for sockets and the Posix threads. He also introduces advanced techniques for: Establishing IPv4/IPv6 interoperability. Implementing non-blocking I/O. Routing sockets. Broadcasting and multicasting. IP options. Multithreading. Advanced name and address conversions. UNIX domain protocols. Raw sockets. Learn how to choose among today's leading client/server design approaches, including TCP iterative, concurrent, preforked and prethreaded servers. Master the X/Open Transport Interface, including XTI TCP clients and servers, name and address functions, options, streams and additional functions. The Internet/intranet revolution has dramatically increased the demand for developers with a sophisticated understanding of network programming APIs, especially sockets. One book contains all you need to know: UNIX Network Programming, Volume 1, Second Edition.}

abstract = {The class NC consists of problems solvable very fast (in time polynomial in log n) in parallel with a feasible (polynomial) number of processors. Many natural problems in NC are known; in this paper an attempt is made to identify important subclasses of NC and give interesting examples in each subclass. The notion of NC1-reducibility is introduced and used throughout (problem R is NC1-reducible to problem S if R can be solved with uniform log-depth circuits using oracles for S). Problems complete with respect to this reducibility are given for many of the subclasses of NC. A general technique, the “parallel greedy algorithm,” is identified and used to show that finding a minimum spanning forest of a graph is reducible to the graph accessibility problem and hence is in NC2 (solvable by uniform Boolean circuits of depth O(log2 n) and polynomial size). The class LOGCFL is given a new characterization in terms of circuit families. The class DET of problems reducible to integer determinants is defined and many examples given. A new problem complete for deterministic polynomial time is given, namely, finding the lexicographically first maximal clique in a graph. This paper is a revised version of S. A. Cook, (1983, in “Proceedings 1983 Intl. Found. Comut. Sci. Conf.,” Lecture Notes in Computer Science Vol. 158, pp. 78–93, Springer-Verlag, Berlin/New York).}
