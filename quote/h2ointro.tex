... An in-memory platform for distributed, scalable machine learning. \pkg{H2O}
uses familiar interfaces like \R, \proglang{Python}, \proglang{Scala}, \proglang{Java}, \proglang{JSON} and the Flow
notebook/web interface, and works seamlessly with big data technologies
like \pkg{Hadoop} and \pkg{Spark}. \pkg{H2O} provides implementations of many popular
algorithms such as GBM, Random Forest, Deep Neural Networks, Word2Vec
and Stacked Ensembles. \pkg{H2O} is extensible so that developers can add data
transformations and custom algorithms of their choice and access them
through all of those clients.
