    The ff package provides atomic data structures that are stored on disk
    but behave (almost) as if they were in RAM by mapping only a subsection
    (pagesize) into main memory (the effective main memory consumption per
    ff object). Several access optimization techniques such as Hyrid Index
    Preprocessing (as.hi, update.ff) and Virtualization (virtual, vt, vw)
    are implemented to achieve good performance even with large datasets.
