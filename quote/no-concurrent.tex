I had a quick look at \R{} and having non-linear contexts is by definition (close to) impossible. The contexts contain many global variables that are stacks themselves, so they can only be unwound linearly down. Hence you cannot have "forks" in contexts due to the stack nature of many things in \R{} (handlers stacks, promise stacks, byte-compiler stacks, ...). To make it even more fun, some are actually local C stack variables, so both \R{} design and C stack is involved here. So allowing this would require some serious re-write of \R{} internals... :/
