	\{disk.frame\} works by breaking large datasets into smaller individual
	chunks and storing the chunks in fst files inside a folder. Each chunk
	is a fst file containing a data.frame/data.table. One can construct the
	original large dataset by loading all the chunks into RAM and row-bind
	all the chunks into one large data.frame. Of course, in practice this
	isn't always possible; hence why we store them as smaller individual
	chunks. \{disk.frame\} makes it easy to manipulate the underlying chunks
	by implementing dplyr functions/verbs and other convenient functions
	(e.g.~the \ccode{cmap} function which applies the function fn to each chunk of a.disk.frame in
	parallel). So that \{disk.frame\} can be manipulated in a similar
	fashion to in-memory data.frames.
