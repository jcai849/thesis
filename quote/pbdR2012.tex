The ``Programming with Big Data in \R'' project (\pkg{pbdR}) is a set of highly
scalable R packages for distributed computing and profiling in data
science. Our packages include high performance, high-level interfaces to
\pkg{MPI}, \pkg{ZeroMQ},\pkg{ScaLAPACK},\pkg{NetCDF4},\pkg{PAPI}, and more. While these libraries
shine brightest on large distributed systems, they also work rather well
on small clusters and usually, surprisingly, even on a laptop with only
two cores. Winner of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory 2016 Significant
Event Award for ``Harnessing HPC Capability at OLCF with the R Language
for Deep Data Science.'' OLCF is the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing
Facility, which currently includes Summit, the most powerful computer
system in the world.
